FOR THE COURSE
The Programming Fundamentals course expands the acquired initial skills for writing program code from the "Programming Basics" course and introduces basic techniques and tools that build on the writing of simple program constructions.

Along with programming techniques, the course develops algorithmic thinking and builds problem-solving skills by working on hundreds of practical exercises. All exercise and homework assignments are assessed in real time with the automated SoftUni Online Judge system. The training methodology is extremely practical. The material provided includes a conceptual theory with numerous examples and a large number of tasks of increasing difficulty, which build on each other and are accompanied by detailed instructions. The practical work in the classroom, with the active help of teachers and assistants (or at home for online students), represents over 70% of the activity in the course.

Much of the practical exercises in the course involve working with linear data structures and word processing. Concepts aimed at introducing students to the basic units of object-oriented programming will also be addressed. Students will get an idea of ​​the entire training program that awaits them until they receive a degree in software engineering. The course has two exams on the material studied, the first aims to test the skills to work with basic data structures, and the final to test knowledge that relates to slightly more complex concepts - associative arrays and word processing, which are studied after the middle of course.
