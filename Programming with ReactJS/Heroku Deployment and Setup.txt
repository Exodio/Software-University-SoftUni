1. Heroku deployment
- register to webpage
- download heroku CLI (does not require to be installed in the windows folder)
- restart your VSC
- once restarted, type in terminal heroku -v (to validate, if installation has passed)
- type in terminal heroku login (Will be redirected to login in website auth)
- Once authenticated, leave webpage and type in terminal heroku create
- Once app is created two URL's will be created(1st URL is app app, 2nd URL git repository for the app)
- Configurate the dynamic port and server: 
const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;
app.listen(port, () => {
console.log(`Server is running at ${port}...!`);
});
});
-run the server
-add engine string in in package json and specify your currently installed node versions, example:
{
  "name": "mern-boiler-plate",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "react-travel-app",
  "main": "index.js",
  "engine": {
    "node": "14.15.4",
    "npm": "6.14.10"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server/index.js",
    "backend": "nodemon server/index.js"
  },
  "author": "exodio",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "bcrypt": "5.0.1",
    "body-parser": "1.18.3",
    "cookie-parser": "1.4.5",
    "express": "4.17.1",
    "jsonwebtoken": "8.5.1",
    "mongoose": "5.4.20"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "2.0.7"
  }
}
- Enter the website, on the burger menu select dashboard
- Select your project, then go to setting and then reveal the Config Vars
- If MongoDB is your current Backend add in the sections under KEY: MONGO_URI and under value (your MongoDB's Cluster Connection String: example -> mongodb+srv://exodio:<password>@cluster0.rspdu.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
- Now as the setup is complete you can proceed with deployment
- Go back to terminal and type the following git add . -> git commit -am "initialize heroku deployment" -> git push origin master -> git push heroku master -> It takes some time (if you are using GitHub Desktop, just commit and push your changes, then in the terminal type in only: git push heroku (easy right ;)
- After deployment you will receive an inuque https, that will lead you to your webpage, basically a redirection to the main page at /, as error may occur if you have not placed any data under /
